## Project Specifications

### Context 	
Computer applications very quickly became an integral part of society, and every day individuals interact with the technology around them in order to make their lives better.  Over the course of the past 12 years in particular, mobile application development has exploded as society becomes ever more dependent upon mobile technologies such as smartphones and tablets.  Many applications have been developed in the past decade to improve the lives of those using them – calendar apps, productivity apps, dating apps – if you can name it, there is likely an app for it.  With technology becoming so integral to our day to day lives, the focus has shifted from making an application for every idea and instead making thoughtful applications that truly bring impact and the betterment of society.  

Throughout our time at DePaul University, we have learned many skills that have helped us to develop well-written, well documented, and quality software.  For this project, we seek to integrate all of these skills together and create a mobile application for the Android ecosystem that best represents what we have learned in our time at DePaul.

### Motivations and Problem Statement 
Thanks to the massive growth in mobile software applications, many applications exist on the market that assist people with personal needs – dating apps, planning apps, cooking apps, fitness apps – the list goes on and on. Many applications seek to solve niche problems and lead to the betterment of a person’s life, which is our ultimate goal in writing this mobile application.  There are plenty of applications for meeting potential relationship partners and even friends, but a group of people have been left behind - pet owners and pet lovers.  What we seek to do is connect these people together.

The problem that this application solves is meeting new friends that have pets and making friends if you have pets. By making a simple android app similar to a dating/friends app we intend to solve the problem of wanting to make friends that have pets or making new friends if you already have pets, without needing to sift through those who would not be interested at all in the fact that you own a dog/cat/other animal friend.  Through the development of this application, we seek to give pet owners and pet lovers an easy platform with which to connect with each other.
